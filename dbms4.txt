Queries:
1. List all the student details studying in fourth semester C’section.

SELECT S.*, SS.SEM, SS.SEC FROM STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, CLASS C WHERE
S.USN=C.USN AND SS.SSID=C.SSID AND SS.SEM=4 AND SS.SEC=’C’;


2. Compute the total number of male and female students in each semester and in each section.

SELECT SS.SEM, SS.SEC, S.GENDER, COUNT (S.GENDER) AS COUNT FROM
STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, CLASS C
WHERE S.USN = C.USN AND SS.SSID = C.SSID
GROUP BY SS.SEM, SS.SEC, S.GENDER ORDER BY SEM;


3. Create a view of Test1 marks of student USN’1BI15CS101’ in all subjects.

CREATE VIEW VW_STUDENT_TEST AS SELECT TEST1,SUBCODE FROM
IAMARKS WHERE USN= 4AD13CS091';
SELECT * FROM VW_STUDENT_TEST


4. Calculate the FinalIA (average of best two test marks) and update the correspondingtable
for all students.

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE AVGMARKS
IS
 CURSOR C_IAMARKS IS
 SELECT GREATEST(TEST1, TEST2) AS A,
 GREATEST(TEST1, TEST3) AS B,
 GREATEST(TEST3, TEST2) AS C
 FROM IAMARKS
 WHERE FINALIA IS NULL
 FOR UPDATE;
 C_A NUMBER;
 C_B NUMBER;
 C_C NUMBER;
 C_SM NUMBER;
 C_AV NUMBER;
BEGIN
 OPEN C_IAMARKS;
 LOOP
 FETCH C_IAMARKS INTO C_A, C_B, C_C;
 EXIT WHEN C_IAMARKS%NOTFOUND;
 IF C_A != C_B THEN
 C_SM := C_A + C_B;
 ELSE
 C_SM := C_A + C_C;
 END IF;
 C_AV := C_SM / 2;
 UPDATE IAMARKS SET FINALIA = C_AV WHERE CURRENT OF C_IAMARKS;
 END LOOP;
 CLOSE C_IAMARKS;
END;
/
EXEC AVGMARKS;


5. Categorize students based on the following criterion:
If FinalIA=17 to 20 then CAT=’Outstanding’
If FinalIA=12 to 16 then CAT=’Average’
If FinalIA<12 then CAT=’Weak’
Give these details only for 8th semester A, B, and C section students.

SELECT S.USN,S.SNAME,S.ADDRESS,S.PHONE,S.GENDER,
(CASE
WHEN IA.FINALIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20 THEN 'OUTSTANDING'
WHEN IA. FINALIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'AVERAGE'
ELSE 'WEAK'
END) AS CAT
FROM STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, IAMARKS IA, SUBJECT SUB WHERE S.USN = IA.USN
AND SS.SSID = IA.SSID AND SUB.SUBCODE = IA.SUBCODE AND SUB.SEM = 8;
